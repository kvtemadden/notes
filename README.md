## Functionality
Upon landing on the initial landing page of the site, users should click "Get Started" to begin logging notes.

They'll be redirected to another page, /notes, which displays all their saved notes (if they have any!).

Users are able to create a note, though they're only able to save the note should it have both a title and description of the actual task within it.

Once the note is no longer needed, users are able to click on the red bin button which will delete the note permanently.
